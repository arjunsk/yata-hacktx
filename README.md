# Yet Another Tone Analyser - YATA

## Inspiration
Likewise R&D Opportunity + Halloween weekend fun!

## What it does
We intended to build a platform that emits customer emotion & facilitate necessary action based on their speech.

## How we built it
We build it using
* Kinesis for Data Stream
* Flink for Stream Processing
* AutoML for Emotional Analysis
* Google Speech To Text for Speech to Text Conversion

## Challenges we ran into
* We were new to Google NLP modules, causing technical hiccups here and then
* Audio Processing using google colab also posed some challenges.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
* Project Naming
* Project Structure

## What we learned
* Google API's are something to be explored before a hackathon

## What's next for YATA
Completing E2E flow using available blocks.
